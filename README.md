# UNICEF Project Alpha Solar Estimator ðŸŒž

> **An interactive web application to estimate solar energy potential for schools, health centers, and other facilities, using mapping technology and data-driven calculations.**

This project was developed to help UNICEF assess solar energy potential at various sites, estimate energy requirements, and calculate potential COâ‚‚ savings and financial benefits. The app uses Google Maps for site mapping and allows users to interact with polygons for area estimation, input facility details, and calculate solar energy potential.

## Features

- **Map Integration**: Uses Google Maps for selecting locations and drawing polygons to estimate area.
- **Facility Details Input**: Accepts data related to site requirements and activity type.
- **Energy Calculation**: Calculates energy production, potential savings, and financial impact.
- **Save & Load Locations**: Stores user-selected locations and associated polygons for easy access.
- **Toggle Map View**: Switch between roadmap and satellite views for better analysis.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or above)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- A **Google Maps API Key** with the following libraries enabled:
  - Maps JavaScript API
  - Places API
  - Geocoding API

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unicef-solar-estimator.git
   cd unicef-solar-estimator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google Maps API key:

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Draw Polygons**: Use the mapâ€™s drawing tools to draw polygons around areas of interest to estimate the available rooftop or ground space.
- **Input Facility Data**: Fill in details about the site, including the estimated energy requirements and number of visitors.
- **Calculate Energy Potential**: After drawing the polygon, click "Calculate" to estimate the site's solar potential.
- **Save & Load Locations**: Save locations and reload them from the "Saved Locations" tab for quick access to previous analyses.

## Configuration

- **Google Maps API**: Ensure your Google Maps API key is stored in `.env` as `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.
- **Map View Options**: Users can toggle between roadmap and satellite views.

## Scripts

- **Start the Application**

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **Run Tests**

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- **Build the Application**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Deploy the Application**

  Deploy your built application to a static site host, like GitHub Pages or Vercel.

- **Commit Files in Chunks** (using `push.sh` script)

  The provided `push.sh` script stages files in 40 small chunks with commit messages. Run this script to push your changes:

  ```bash
  ./push.sh
  ```

  Ensure `.env` and `push.sh` are in `.gitignore` before running the script.

## Technologies

- **React** with **Material-UI** for the user interface
- **Google Maps API** for mapping and polygon drawing
- **Axios** for handling API requests
- **JavaScript** for core application logic
